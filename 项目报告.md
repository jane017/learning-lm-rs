# 简单大模型推理系统
## 一、作业阶段
已实现SwiGLU算子、RMS Normalization算子、矩阵乘算子、mlp函数及模型加载
## 二、项目阶段
### 1. 模型结构：Self-Attention
self-attention实现过程中，通过对Q、K、V张量分别进行手动转置再用矩阵乘算子的方式实现权重矩阵的计算
### 2. 功能：文本生成
在`src/model.rs`中依次实现forward函数、generate函数后，执行main函数得到以下文本生成结果
``` text
Choose the number of function: 1. A story ; 2. A chat
1
Once upon a time, a little boy named Tim went for a walk. He saw a lion named Sue. He loved to explore and go closer. He saw a big box on the ground. Tim wanted to show his friend, Sue. Sue said, "Hello, Mr. Samp." Tim said, "Hi, Mr. Lier! Do you want to join the cool pies?" Sue said, "Sue, I don't want to climb it." Tim listened to Sue. They walked and looked for Lione.
But Tim was a big bird stuck in a tree and a hole from the tree. They saw big trees, filk, and pretty leaves around the tree. Lizzy was so happy! The tree was gone and the bird became best friends. They played together and had a fun day together.<|end_story|>
``` 

### 3. 功能：AI对话
新建`src/chat.rs`文件，构造Message模板，参考story模型加载chat模型，并编写input_prompt函数实现将用户输入转换为正确的模板格式，在`src/model.rs`中编写chat_generate函数实现AI对话，并支持在多轮对话中保存和管理用户的kvcache.
通过将过程张量打印到.txt的方式进行代码调试和错误检查。
直接执行main函数可以开始AI对话，以下为运行结果实例
``` text
Choose the number of function: 1. A story ; 2. A chat
2
=========> hello
Assistant: Great question! If you're feeling like an outsider, I would be happy to help you with that! Let me know if you have any other questions.
=========> tell me a story about love
Assistant: I don't have any personal information about love, but I'm here to assist you with understanding the text. Could you please suggest some places where I can learn more about love? maybe the places you would like to visit if you ever saw something new or similar to the place you are? maybe some recommendations for places you're interested in or if you have any other questions.
=========> ^C
``` 

### 以上为项目实现的功能，有待提高的点如下
1、在运行AI对话功能时，运行时长显著慢于文本生成，功能实现上有很多需要进一步优化的代码过程，例如self-attention实现时进行了多次的矩阵转置，占用了不少内存空间，降低了计算效率。
2、待进一步拓展实现多会话管理以及历史会话回滚，以及网络服务 API等。
