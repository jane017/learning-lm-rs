Once upon a time, a little boy named Tim went for a walk. He saw a lion named Sue. He loved to explore and go closer. He saw a big box on the ground. Tim wanted to show his friend, Sue. Sue said, "Hello, Mr. Samp." Tim said, "Hi, Mr. Lier! Do you want to join the cool pies?" Sue said, "Sue, I don't want to climb it." Tim listened to Sue. They walked and looked for Lione.
But Tim was a big bird stuck in a tree and a hole from the tree. They saw big trees, filk, and pretty leaves around the tree. Lizzy was so happy! The tree was gone and the bird became best friends. They played together and had a fun day together.<|end_story|>
